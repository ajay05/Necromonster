----------------------------------------------

A 2D topdown 2x RPG. Requires pygame and numpy to run.

Pretty much it's one of those whole the kingdom is experiencing dark times things in medieval times. A bunch of monsters are attacking people in the towns and no one in the kingdom knows why, or can stop the attacks. Everyone looks to the court wizard to explain things, but he can't. As things get progressively worse, tensions build in the kingdom and the court wizard is banished for being unable to locate the source of the problem.
He wanders the the land until he comes across a really old decrepit tower (stone).
Since night is coming, he decides to hide away for the night in the tower.
Inside he finds a [insert magic item] 
that lets him control one of the monsters that wander around in the night. He also finds a chest, an old bed, and a map mounted on the wall.
Having no better place to stay, he decides to stay here and try to earn his role in the kingdom back by defeating the monster source.

Pretty much the main game mechanic is that you control a monster which goes into dungeons and gets loot for you.
There are 2 xp bars, the fast filling monster bar, and slow filling wizard bar.
The monster levels like you'd expect, but when it dies, it's a permadeath. The wizard goes on to summon more monsters, who bring back loot from dungeons that make him stronger. Instead of getting classic pre-made weapons and armor in dungeons, you get material(s) for creating new 
weapons, tools, and armor. These materials can then be used to create new items at a blacksmith. Tools will also be enchantable to give them interesting, unique, and special effect(s).
